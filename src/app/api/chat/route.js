SIP stands for Systematic Investment Plan.

It means investing a fixed amount regularly into an investment such as mutual funds.

Benefits of SIP:
• Builds discipline in investing
• Takes advantage of market fluctuations
• Uses the power of compounding

In your case:

To achieve a goal value of ₹${goalCost.toLocaleString()} over ${years} years,
you would need to invest about ₹${sip.toLocaleString()} every month.
`;

  // -------------------------------
  // COMPOUNDING
  // -------------------------------

  else if (msg.includes("compound") || msg.includes("compounding")) {

    reply = `
Compounding means earning returns on both your original investment and the returns already generated.

Example:

If you invest regularly and earn ${returnRate}% returns,
your money grows faster over time because each year's returns
also start generating returns.

This is why long-term investing is powerful.

Your plan assumes ${returnRate}% expected return over ${years} years.
`;

  }

  // -------------------------------
  // INFLATION
  // -------------------------------

  else if (msg.includes("inflation")) {

    reply = `
Inflation is the rise in prices over time which reduces purchasing power.

For example:

If inflation is ${inflation}%,
something costing ₹${goalCost.toLocaleString()} today will cost much more in ${years} years.

That is why financial planning must adjust goals for inflation.

  // -------------------------------

  else if (msg.includes("health") || msg.includes("score")) {

    reply = `
Your Financial Health Score is ${healthScore}/100.

Status: ${healthStatus}

A higher score means your investment plan is strong and achievable.
`;

  // -------------------------------
  // MUTUAL FUNDS
  // -------------------------------

  else if (msg.includes("mutual fund")) {

    reply = `
A mutual fund pools money from many investors
and invests it in stocks, bonds, or other assets.

Benefits:
• Diversification
• Professional fund management
• Accessible through SIP investments
`;

  }

  // -------------------------------
  // DIVERSIFICATION
  // -------------------------------

  else if (msg.includes("diversification")) {

    reply = `
Diversification means spreading investments across different assets
like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

This reduces risk because poor performance of one asset
may be balanced by others.

Your financial goal planning summary:

Goal Cost Today: ₹${goalCost.toLocaleString()}

Investment Period: ${years} years

Expected Return: ${returnRate}%

Required Monthly SIP: ₹${sip.toLocaleString()}

Maintaining consistent SIP contributions can help achieve this goal.
